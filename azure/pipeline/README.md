## HOW TO FIND LIST VERSION EXTENSION TO USE ( SONAQUE, DOCKER,...)
To find the list of versions for the SonarQube Azure DevOps extension, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your Azure DevOps account.
2. Go to the Organization settings.
3. Click on Extensions under the Extensions section.
4. Find the SonarQube extension and click on it.
5. You will be able to see the current version of the extension and the version history.

Please note that the version of the SonarQube extension and the version of the tasks (like `SonarQubePrepare@4`) are not the same. The task version is defined by the extension and can be different from the extension version. The task version is usually updated when there are significant changes in the task.

Unfortunately, Azure DevOps does not provide a direct way to list all available versions of a specific task. The version is usually specified in the task definition in the extension's source code. You can check the source code of the extension (if it's open source) to find the available versions of a task.
