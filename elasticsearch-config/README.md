# Elasticsearch Configuration Project

This project contains the necessary configuration files for setting up an Elasticsearch instance.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `config/elasticsearch.yml`: Main configuration file for Elasticsearch.
- `config/jvm.options`: Configuration options for the JVM.
- `data`: Directory for Elasticsearch data storage.
- `logs`: Directory for Elasticsearch log files.

## Setup

1. Update the `elasticsearch.yml` and `jvm.options` files in the `config` directory as per your requirements.
2. Ensure that the `data` and `logs` directories have the appropriate permissions for Elasticsearch to read and write data.
3. Start your Elasticsearch instance. It will use the provided configuration files and directories for operation.

Please refer to the official Elasticsearch documentation for more details on the configuration options available.
