# My Project

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to integrate Snyk security scanning into a Jenkins pipeline.

## Setup

1. Install Jenkins on your machine or server.
2. Install Snyk CLI globally or locally in your project.
3. Configure Snyk with your API token.

## Usage

1. Push your code to your repository.
2. Jenkins will automatically detect the changes and start the build process.
3. The Jenkins pipeline will run the Snyk security scan as one of its steps.
4. If any vulnerabilities are found, the build will fail and you will be notified.
